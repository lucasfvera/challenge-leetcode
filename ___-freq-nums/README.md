# ___. Exercise

This exercise was from an assessment that's why it doesn't have number.

Given an array of numbers and its length n, return a new array with the numbers ordered by frequency.
If the frequency is the same, then ordered it by value.
The output should be a string with the numbers separted by a space.

Example

n = 5
arr = [3,3,2,2,1]

Expected Output

"1 2 2 3 3"


Example

n = 6
arr = [4,4,5,5,6,3]

Expected Output

"4 4 5 5 3 6"
