# ___. Exercise

This exercise was from an assessment that's why it doesn't have number.


Given a minified jsonStr print the original JSON.

Example

```
# Input

"{"name":"John","age":30,"interests":["food","movies"],"user":{"username":"john doe","city":"New York"}}"

# Expected output

{
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "interests": [
        "food",
        "movies"
    ],
    "user": {
        "username": "john doe",
        "city": "new york"
    }
}
